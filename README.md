# hack-into-can-bus

Can your car be hacked from a remote location?

Yeah sure why not ;)


All new car uses can to communicate, good for us, there is nothing in the name of security in it

A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer; thats all it is. And then there is this OBD2. Now all someone has to do is send some can message with priority 0...

Will try to build on such device using raspberry pi and ELM327, will be intresting.
